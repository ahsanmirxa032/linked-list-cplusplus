# linked-list-cplusplus
This repository contains an implementation of a linked list data structure in C++.
Linked lists are a fundamental data structure in computer science that are used to store a collection of elements in a sequence. Unlike arrays, linked lists do not require contiguous memory allocation, making them more flexible for dynamic data structures.  
The linked list implementation in this repository includes basic functionality such as insertion, deletion, and traversal of nodes.
Each node in the linked list contains a value and a reference to the next node in the list. The implementation is designed to be simple and easy to understand for beginners, while also being efficient and scalable for more advanced users. 
The repository also includes several examples of how to use the linked list implementation in various contexts. These examples demonstrate how linked lists can be used to solve a variety of programming problems, including implementing other data structures such as stacks and queues. 
If you're interested in learning more about linked lists or looking for a solid implementation to use in your own projects, this repository is an excellent resource to check out. Feel free to clone the repository and use the code for your own projects, and don't hesitate to ask questions or provide feedback!
